## UX

### Project Goals

<br>

The purpose of this project is to 

*"...build a full-stack site based around business logic used to control a centrally-owned dataset. You will set up an authentication mechanism and provide paid access to the site's data and/or other activities based on the dataset, such as the purchase of a product/service"* using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Python+Django, a relational database (recommending MySQL or Postgres), Stripe payments
and possible additional libraries and API's. 

**Value provided:**
1. By authenticating on the site and paying for some of its services, users can advance their own goals. Before authenticating, the site makes it clear how those goals would be furthered by the site.
2. The site owner is able to make money by providing this set of services to the users. There is no way for a regular user to bypass the site's mechanisms and derive all of the value available to paid users without paying.

This project has a full set of CRUD (creation, reading, updating and deletion of data records) features. CRUD at user interface level:

|Operation|SQL|HTTP|DDS|Description|
|---|----|----|----|----|
|**Create**|INSERT|PUT/POST|Write|Create a resource: Users can create profiles by signing up. Users can create orders by adding items to bag annd then follow the checkout procedure. Users can create a blog post in BOHO Blog page. Admin can create products and blog posts.
|**Read**|SELECT|GET|Read|Retrieve a resource: Users can retrieve, search and view products.
|**Update**|UPDATE|PUT/PATCH/POST|Write|Update a resource: Users can update/edit the delivery information. Admin can update/edit products and blog posts.
|**Delete**|DELETE|DELETE|Dispose|Delete a resource: Admin can delete products, registered users and blog posts.

## Business Goals

<br>

This e-commerce website focuses on maximizing direct sales to new and returning customers/visitors (convert a website visitor into a customer) by simplify and optimize site content to be as easy as possible to make a purchase. This is made possible by having a user friendly and well designed online shop that enables secure purchases, inspire consumers and has a distinct and specialized sortiment (bohemian). Except that, another goal is to establishing brand recognition in the industry by presenting and stick to a bohemian nich and lifestyle. Mission statement: *"To offer on trend, selected and exclusive boho inspired home decor and fashion items".* 

### Target group

The target group for B.L is potential customers liking the bohemian style in home decor and fashion. Since this is e-commerce the conversions is the most important part, rather than traffic it self. Conversions take place when targeted traffic meets relevant offer. So it's important that B.L clearly defined what they offers. Thats why B.L has a really well defined business name, website and offer so it can avoid irrelevant traffic (traffic not interested in boho inspired e-commerce). By basic SEO and a distinct website (mainly the landing page) B.L defines that they offer boho inspired homedecor and fashion. E-commerce sales increaces worldwide, and develop the need to determine target group, particularly ecommerce stores. B.L ideal customer is a person (gender non relevant) that likes/has a boho inpired lifestyle, more than demographic data. Online, the location matters less due to home delivery. Age is not what it used to be, the age isn't the defining thing if somebody turns out to be a paying customer or not. While it's important to reach as many people as possible, and it often seems like focusing only on specific segments of the population could be limiting, you also need to reach potential consumers that isn't into boho style today, but has the potential to be. 

B.L can also make use of the demographical information, such as name, address, user behavior etc. that B.L gets when users filling out the order form, where they also can get access to the newsletter. 

In addition to the goals above;

## Design Choices

### Color scheme
    
The page consists of a white base with black, orange and yellow as accent colors. The combination of black and white offers the maximum contrast possible, as they come from opposite ends of the color spectrum. Black and white websites are classical, strong, and powerful. Apart from black and white being a risk-free combination and ensuring a design will look clean, removing color forces a designer to rely on other elements in their web designs such as the products, typography, layout, or grid to catch the viewers' attention. Boho style/the products has asymmetrical layouts, variegated patterns and handcrafted textures. Placed in a clean, contemporary space, layers of colorful textiles deliver an unexpected twist. Thats what I had in mind chosing colors and style for this website.  
  
Orange is an attention-grabbing color that tends to stand out visually as an accent standing out against neutral colors. Orange is a very creative color thatâ€™s also associated with adventure and youth. Itâ€™s perceived as very energetic. Because of orangeâ€™s strong ties to 70s style, it can also evoke a retro feeling which corresponds well with B.L.

Orange has very high visibility, you can use it to draw attention and highlight the most important elements of your design. I used it as a compliment to the crisp and clean white and black colors. 

I've used yellow text shadows in a few different places. This glowing yellow is an attention-getter and at the same time it gives a smooth and soft impression, and its contrast with white or black is one of the most visible color combinations. 

Shop now button at landing page has a subtly animated shadow effect. Well-designed animation can improve usability and make the interaction with a site more engaging and delightful.Optimal speed for interface animation is between 200 and 500 ms. My animation is set to 300 ms. Too much animation can confuse the user and create a negative emotional effect and takes the focus away from the message.

The CTA button is used to help user navigate the site and to get visitors to do what I want them to do (look at the products and make a purchase). The CTA text used is "Shop now", ans is direct and clear. It engages the visitor and makes it crystal clear which action the visitor is expected to take (click and shop). The CTA copy simply states the websiteâ€™s conversion goal. By adding the word "now", I'm creating a sense of urgency that is a necessary condition for successful CTA copy. 

All buttons are either black, white or orange.

### Typography

This project contains two different fonts, one type for headings and CTAs (buttons), and another for body. The color contrast between the black and white text, makes it clear and distinct. A reader tends to scan down the left side of the page, looking for interesting key words in left-aligned headings or text. They then tend to stop and read (to the right) when he or she comes to something interesting. The result looks something like an F, thats why this theory is called F-pattern and thats why this project is built with that in mind. There are generously spacing between the text which indicates an elementâ€™s meaning and importance using only visuals. 

Lato is an open source, sans-serif font. Lato font is the main font used throughout the site with Architects Daughter font used to headers and logo. The font is created to give the letterforms familiar harmony and elegance. The semi-rounded details of the letters give Lato a feeling of warmth, while the strong structure provides stability and seriousness. Lato is used in the body content for the site to appear to be approachable which is the main goal for this website. 
    
Architects Daughter font incorporates the graphic, squared look of architectural writing, combined with the natural feel of daily handwriting. It is clean but unconventional and gives the site a relaxed vibe. The combination of these two fonts represents both the webshop/business side aswell as the relaxed boho approach.

### Imagery

This projects strong imagery complements the overall brand story and really takes advantages of the power of visual storytelling. Some say you only have up to 7â€“8 seconds to capture a userâ€™s attention before they click through to another competitorâ€™s site. The use of persuasive imagery is a good way to try and retain them. Humans tends to process visual information from an image far quicker than text, which makes imagery a powerful tool. When confronted with a powerful image, consumers immediately connect with the brand on an emotional level. Thats why the site has a full-width hero image that reflects the style the business wants to signal. The hero image on the landing page gives the site a dramatic appearance and sets the tone for the boho inspired page. It provides an immediate immersive experience by confronting the user first-off with a strong image which evokes an emotional response. There are a short, sharp and descriptive text-on-image that is not takning any of the power away from the hero image. 

I use lot of space around the product images and content to get the visitor an uncluttered and comfortable browsing experience on all device sizes. The product images for the e-commerce part of the site is chosen to be more artistic than detailed/informative to fit the boho-tone. The appearance is aiming to be appealing to the target audience. All images are choosen to work in tandem with the content. 

### Icons

All icons used are taken from Font Awsome. The use of icons in web design is a proven method to modernize a website and help direct user flow. Adding icons to the site's content helps a user better process the information and provides a visual focus point that grounds a user to a specific section. I used an boho inspired arrow icon recurring throughout the site, to improve visual and keep a common theme throughout the site.

<br>

## Features left to implement

* Comments and ability to share blog posts to social media (potential to convert more readers into paying customers). 
* Elaborate the SKU numbers, to make even more logical to Administrator.
* Allow the contact form confirmation mail (in About Us page) to send to the actual person that filled the form out (and not to me as it does to day). 
* Social media login.
* More categories. 
* Function to make users giving rating. To day set by Admin based on sales.  
* Email notification functionality for users to be alerted when a new product or service is added.
* User profile picture functionality, allowing users to add profile pictures. Nice feature if posting blog posts. 
* Allowing users to comment the products.
* Easier to get contacted by business partners regarding any collaboration, business deals and sponsorship if site has an more expanded contact/business information. 
* Get more contact information about the registered users (by expanding the details in "My Account" to be able to reach out (newsletters, offers etc).
* Expand blog section to have different categories, ideas, what products are on sale, new in etc.  
* Customize site based on Google Analytics statistic(and other sources). Who are the visitors and customers? What pages and products are popular and not and adjust sortiment/site according to that information to increases the ROI (return on investment). 


## Security features

* To ensure that the website is secure, code has @login_required decorators in msp4 app, that makes Django check whether the user is logged in before executing the view. If not logged in user get redirected to sign in page. I also use this decorator for the Profile view, since only logged in users should be able to access. If somebody somehow found out the URL for the edit and delete product management, they could possibly delete all products, thats why the decorators are needed. Only superuser are able to edit and delete, just as it should be. 

* If user accendentally or intentionally closes the browser window after the payment is confirmed but before the form is submitted, there would be a payment in Stripe, but no order in the database. To prevent this situation; Each time an event occurs on Stripe (such as a payment intent being created) a payment being completed on Stripe a webhook is sent out that we can listen for. Webhooks are like the signals django sends each time a model is saved or deleted. Except that they are sent securely from Stripe to a url we specify. *(from Boutique Ado project, Stripe, part 10)*

* [Desktop](https://github.com/jennymalmoe/MSP4/tree/main/wireframes/desktop)


**Post wireframes design changes:**
While the project relied on these wireframes, there are some differences between the wireframes and the final product; 

* No spinner icon and background image triggered while Stripe payment is processing.
* An "About Us" page with a contact form was added.
